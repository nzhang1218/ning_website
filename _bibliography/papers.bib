abstract = {We demonstrate an ultra-high-density source-detector (SD) diffuse optical tomography system scalable to thousands of combinatorial SD pairs per cm3 of total voxel volume. We demonstrate the imaging of dynamic targets (including phantom arteries) with 100 um resolution at over 10\&\#x2005;Hz frame rate within turbid media (\&gt; 60 MFP). Further, as a step toward a wearable mobile imager, we introduce monolithic mm-size dense semiconductor laser array chips as sources for potential unobtrusive epidermal tomographic use.},
