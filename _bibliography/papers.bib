  abstract = {For many cerebrovascular diseases both blood pressure (BP) and hemodynamic changes are important clinical variables. In this paper, we describe the development of a novel approach to noninvasively and simultaneously monitor cerebral hemodynamics, BP, and other important parameters at high temporal resolution (250 Hz sampling rate). In this approach, cerebral hemodynamics are acquired using near infrared spectroscopy based sensors and algorithms, whereas continuous BP is acquired by superficial temporal artery tonometry with pulse transit time based drift correction. The sensors, monitoring system, and data analysis algorithms used in the prototype for this approach are reported in detail in this paper. Preliminary performance tests demonstrated that we were able to simultaneously and noninvasively record and reveal cerebral hemodynamics and BP during people's daily activity. As examples, we report dynamic cerebral hemodynamic and BP fluctuations during postural changes and micturition. These preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, and its unique power in catching hemodynamics and BP fluctuations during transient symptoms (such as syncope) and revealing the dynamic features of related events.},

  month = {May},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {The purpose of this research is to investigate the feasibility of developing a medical device to predict and diagnose an ischemic stroke by (1) counting the numbers of emboli which flow to cerebral vessels through CCA, (2) measuring the sizes of the emboli, (3) differentiating the types of the emboli, based on our diffuse optical method. The final goal is to develop a wearable medical system to help predict and diagnose an ischemic stroke noninvasively in real-time, 24/7 with low cost. The system will be used in Step-down Units, Intensive Care Units, Emergency Rooms and Operation Rooms in hospitals (controlled environments) on high stroke risk patients such as patients who are having surgeries or have hypertension or had stroke before.},
